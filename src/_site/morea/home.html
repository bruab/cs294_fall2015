<p>This class will focus on skills and tools and techniques necessary to use Python for scientific programming.</p>

<p>Here is the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/cs294-python-syllabus">syllabus</a>. TL;DR Click on “Readings” and read the stuff. Then click on “Experiences” and do the stuff.</p>

<h4 id="mystery-assignment">Mystery Assignment</h4>

<p>I. Find a Python project of interest on GitHub*. Clone and run the code. (No need to fork unless you just love forking.) Send me an email with four pieces of information:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The URL to the repository</li>
  <li>Why you picked this project</li>
  <li>The command you ran</li>
  <li>The result of running the command</li>
</ol>

<p>If you clone something and you can’t get it to run, don’t worry – it happens. Just delete it and try another project.</p>

<h4 id="conferences">Conferences</h4>

<p>No class on Monday, September 7th. (It’s Labor Day.) The following Wednesday (9/9) and the Monday after (9/14) we’ll have conferences. Each student should sign up for one time slot, either on Wednesday or on Monday (not both). <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VGaXQUSWVQ1XiD89y3z9c-bUYEakARU_bzK251VzcJY/edit?usp=sharing">Here</a> is a link to the signup sheet. You have to edit the document to sign up, which means being logged in with your UH account. LMK if that’s a pain.</p>

<h4 id="command-line-vine-contest">Command Line Vine Contest</h4>

<p>Someone mentioned animated gifs and vines in class. I’ll offer 1 point to anyone who submits one which demonstrates something you can do at the command line. It doesn’t have to be Python, but it can be. Inspired by <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cloud-to-butt-plus/apmlngnhgbnjpajelfkmabhkfapgnoai">this chrome plugin</a>, here is <a href="http://imgur.com/Dgk4Le9">mine</a>. Best submission (to be decided by popular vote) gets three points. Deadline: Tuesday, September 15.</p>

<h4 id="blog-post-grades">Blog Post Grades</h4>

<p>Your first three blog posts aren’t due until Friday, 9/4, but I’ve graded most of what’s been submitted. Some of you have really pushed the boundaries of slackery; some of you got bonus points. To see examples of posts worth 1.5-2 points, take a look at <a href="http://gigaelectronvolts.tumblr.com/post/127461192421/data-sharing">this one</a> or <a href="https://johfa.wordpress.com/2015/08/25/the-development-environment/">this one</a> or maybe <a href="https://mkb0517.wordpress.com/2015/08/26/describing-my-dev-environment-because-apparently-thats-a-thing/">this one</a>. Notice the presence of links, images, good organization, thoroughness, introspection and snark.</p>
