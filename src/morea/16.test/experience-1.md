### Re-create a repository, complete with unit tests

For one point:

- *Clone* (don't fork) this repository: [https://github.com/Codenhance/unit_conversions](https://github.com/Codenhance/unit_conversions)
- Run `main.py` and `run_tests.py` and see what they do
- Create a new repository *on GitHub* called "unit_conversions"
  - Add a README and a LICENSE and a .gitignore
  - Clone it to your machine
- Type the code from the original repository into identically-named files and folders in your newly-cloned repository
- Run `main.py` and `run_tests.py` and verify that they work
- Push your changes to GitHub
- Paste the URL to your repository and @mention me on Slack

You're welcome to make changes or additions to the program but they're not necessary for credit.

For an additional point:

- Write another function, and two tests to cover it. (Tell me you did so or I might miss it.)
