### Complete learnGitBranching and share

This is a challenging, time-consuming assignment. If you complete it, you will probably know more about version control than your instructor. Please note that it is all-or-nothing -- you must complete all lessons and present them in order to receive points. Start early!

Visit this [online git tutorial](http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/). It runs entirely in your browser. At last count, it consisted of 18 lessons in the "Main" category and 15 lessons in the "Remote" category. You are to complete them all. There's a lot of reading involved, and probably a fair bit of confusion. Don't try to do it in a day.

Once you've completed all of the lessons, choose two of them to explain in detail. Come up with an example scenario where each lesson could be applied -- in other words, dream up a mock software project that requires the technique explained by the lesson. 

For points, put together a few slides documenting the following:

- How much time you spent completing the lessons
- The two lessons you chose to demonstrate
- Your use case for each lesson

You should also be prepared to complete any of the lessons from the site on request.

Just @mention me on Slack if you need help getting started, or when you're ready to present.
