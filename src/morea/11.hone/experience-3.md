### Project Euler

Create an account at [https://projecteuler.net/](https://projecteuler.net/). The site consists of increasingly challenging math-related programming problems. Solve the first five problems, then give the class a brief, informal code review demonstrating one of your solutions. This is worth 2 points. You can repeat the process with another five problems, and another, up to a total of 8 points.
