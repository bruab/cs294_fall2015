### Blog About Data Sharing

Write a few paragraphs about your own opinions and/or experiences regarding 
data sharing and reproducibility in science. Paste a link to the post into 
[Laulima](https://laulima.hawaii.edu/portal) for credit.

Some evidence of planning and organization is expected. No points deducted
for grammar or spelling, but don't embarrass yourself please. Links and images
are nice, too.
