# CS 294 - Python Programming

This class will focus on skills and tools and techniques necessary to use Python for scientific programming.

Here is the [syllabus](http://tinyurl.com/cs294-python-syllabus). TL;DR Click on "Readings" and read the stuff. Then click on "Experiences" and do the stuff.

Here's the [calendar](http://tinyurl.com/cs294-python-calendar). Here are the class [repos](https://github.com/cs294-python/).

If you're running VirtualBox with the Ubuntu image I provided, the sudo password is "cs294_fall2015" without the quotes.

## News

#### Mystery Assignment

I. Find a Python project of interest on GitHub*. Clone and run the code from the command line. (No need to fork unless you just love forking.) Send me an email with four pieces of information:

1. The URL to the repository
2. Why you picked this project
3. The command you ran
4. The result of running the command

If you clone something and you can't get it to run, don't worry -- it happens. Just delete it and try another project.

*[Here](https://github.com/saffsd/langid.py) are [some](https://github.com/thearn/game-of-life) [suggestions](https://github.com/fogleman/Minecraft), but you should really [search](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=stars%3A%3E5+language%3APython+size%3A%3C150&type=Repositories&ref=searchresults) or browse and find something you like.

#### Conferences

No class on Monday, September 7th. (It's Labor Day.) The following Wednesday (9/9) and the Monday after (9/14) we'll have conferences. Each student should sign up for one time slot, either on Wednesday or on Monday (not both). [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VGaXQUSWVQ1XiD89y3z9c-bUYEakARU_bzK251VzcJY/edit?usp=sharing) is a link to the signup sheet. You have to edit the document to sign up, which means being logged in with your UH account. LMK if that's a pain.

#### Command Line Vine Contest

Someone mentioned animated gifs and vines in class. I'll offer 1 point to anyone who submits one which demonstrates something you can do at the command line. It doesn't have to be Python, but it can be. Inspired by [this chrome plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cloud-to-butt-plus/apmlngnhgbnjpajelfkmabhkfapgnoai), here is [mine](http://imgur.com/Dgk4Le9). Best submission (to be decided by popular vote) gets three points. Deadline: Tuesday, September 15.

#### Blog Post Grades

Your first three blog posts aren't due until Friday, 9/4, but I've graded most of what's been submitted. Some of you have really pushed the boundaries of slackery; some of you got bonus points. To see examples of posts worth 1.5-2 points, take a look at [this one](http://gigaelectronvolts.tumblr.com/post/127461192421/data-sharing) or [this one](https://johfa.wordpress.com/2015/08/25/the-development-environment/) or maybe [this one](https://mkb0517.wordpress.com/2015/08/26/describing-my-dev-environment-because-apparently-thats-a-thing/). Notice the presence of links, images, good organization, thoroughness, introspection and snark.
