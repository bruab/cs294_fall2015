#### Blog Post Grades

Your first three blog posts aren't due until Friday, 9/4, but I've graded most of what's been submitted. Some of you have really pushed the boundaries of slackery; some of you got bonus points. To see examples of posts worth 1.5-2 points, take a look at [this one](http://gigaelectronvolts.tumblr.com/post/127461192421/data-sharing) or [this one](https://johfa.wordpress.com/2015/08/25/the-development-environment/) or maybe [this one](https://mkb0517.wordpress.com/2015/08/26/describing-my-dev-environment-because-apparently-thats-a-thing/). Notice the presence of links, images, good organization, thoroughness, introspection and snark.
