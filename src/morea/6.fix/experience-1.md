# Fix a TypeError

This experience will give you more practice with git and vim, and get you started on a lifelong process of fixing errors that seemingly come from nowhere :)

- Fork this repository: [https://github.com/Codenhance/debug_me](https://github.com/Codenhance/debug_me)
- Clone it to your machine and run it as instructed in the README
- Confirm that you receive a TypeError
- Open `add_five.py` in Vim and correct the error by converting `user_input` to an integer or float
- Add/Commit/Push your changes for credit

Here is an [animated gif](http://imgur.com/1rcnRlu) of the edit you need to make. (I typed 'G' to go to the end of the file, then 'k' to go up one line. Then 'w', 'w', 'w' to move across the line one word at a time. I pressed 'i' to enter Insert mode, and typed 'int('. Then I pressed escape to go back to Normal mode. After that, I typed 'A' to enter Insert mode *at the end of the current line*, and typed ')'. Exit Insert mode, ':wq' and that's it. You can probably do better.)
