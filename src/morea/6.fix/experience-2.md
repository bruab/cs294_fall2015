# Fix Some Syntax Errors

This experience continues the fun you had with debugging a Type Error. This time there's a whole pile of errors to sort through!

- *Clone* this repository (no need to fork, or to use a forked version): [https://github.com/Codenhance/debug_me](https://github.com/Codenhance/debug_me). 
- Try running `interview.py`. You should get a SyntaxError.
- Open the file in Vim, navigate to the line causing the error, and fix it. Note: sometimes the error is on the *preceding* line.
- Save, run the file again, and move on to the next error.
- Once the script is running, answer the questions. It will write a file.
- Upload this file to Slack and @mention me for a point

Here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fB4DlyGLCrI) of me debugging the whole thing. Only watch it if you get stuck!

Tips:

- In Vim, type `:9` and press enter to go straight to line 9. Each error tells you the offending line number, so you can go straight to the problem with laser focus.
- Pay attention to anything repetitive or frustrating. Are you pressing `j` and `l` a hundred times? Try using `/` to search, or `w` and `b` to go forward/backward one word at a time.
- Most errors are either stolen directly from the reading on "16 Common Errors" or can be detected by comparing the incorrect line with the lines above and below it.
- Ask for help on Slack if you're stuck. *I do not consider this cheating. I consider it "programming." Knowing when and where to get help will save you tons of time*.
