### Type Code for 2 Hours

Choose one of the textbooks from this module's Readings and spend two hours reading it *and typing all the examples*. No skipping the code parts, and no copy-pasting. Take your time. You're not being rewarded for how far you get.

For a point:

- *Keep track of your time*. Did you work for two hours straight, or break it into 30 minute blocks?
- Type all the code you're told to type; run all the code you're told to run. Make notes about any weird results, distractions or frustration you experience
- Write a *brief* blog post in which you outline
  - Which book you chose and why
  - Details about how you spent the two hours
  - How far you got
  - Any problems you had
  - Your overall impression of the experience. Did it help?

Post your blog post URL into Slack (don't forget to @mention me) for one point. You'll then be free to repeat the process for another two hours (and another blog post) for another point, up to 6 points total.
