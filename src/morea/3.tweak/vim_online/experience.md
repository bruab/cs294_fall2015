### Try Vim Online

Visit this [super-adorable online vim tutorial](http://www.openvim.com/tutorial.html). Complete as much as you can, take a screenshot, then upload it to [Laulima](https://laulima.hawaii.edu/portal) for points points points.

If the site is slow, or if you're feeling extra hackery today, you can run the tutorial locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/egaga/openvim.git
cd openvim/
firefox tutorial.html
```
