### Try Vim Online

Here's a [lesson](http://codenhance.com/2015/08/26/how-to-vim/) I slapped together. You'll clone a repository with some lovely poetry in it, only to find one of the poems has been mangled. You'll then time yourself using Vim to fix the poem four times, following four different approaches. (Inbetween fixes, you'll use 'git checkout' to undo your edits on the file.)

To receive credit, send me an email with a list of how long each approach took you, plus a comment about how easy or terrible you found the experience to be.
