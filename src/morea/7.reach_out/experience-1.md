### Blog about a Mentor's Coding Habits and Advice

Find someone who writes Python code *at their job* and somehow charm them into a ten minute phone conversation. Ask for advice, warnings, or just find out more about what they do. Summarize your conversation in a blog post. Don't just report facts -- what are your opinions about what they said?

*Don't publish anybody's name or personal info unless they explicitly say it's okay.*

Paste a link to your post into Slack for credit.
