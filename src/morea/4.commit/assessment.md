One of the outcomes for this module was for students to report on their expectations for the class. Here is a sampling of ideas and possible goals mentioned in the first class meeting:

* android python app
* simulations on the entire universe's cats
* robot hawk
* working, useable code
* windows software
* useful scripts for my job
* an android app or plugins for blender games
* death star
* a program to pull relevant information from a website
* abstract algebra made easy
* a program
* observatory archive through python
* something that makes astro monkey work not so monkey work-like
* death+star+python

At least two or three of these things will happen :)
