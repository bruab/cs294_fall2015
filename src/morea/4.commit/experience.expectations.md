### Blog about your expectations for the class

Write a blog post, as long as you like, about what you hope to learn from 
this class and what you hope to do afterward. 

The more you can tell me, the better the class will be, so don't hold back.

Opinions on the class format are also welcome, though it may be too late to
fix some stuff.
