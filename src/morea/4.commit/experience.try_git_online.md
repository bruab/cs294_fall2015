### Try git Online

Visit this [online git tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1). Try to get through the whole thing, making a note of the parts that make ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE AT ALL. Take a screenshot when you're done.

Email me the screenshot and describe the confusing bits to receive credit.
