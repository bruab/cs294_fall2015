### Create your own toy Python package

Follow [this tutorial](http://codenhance.com/2015/10/12/python-modules-and-packages.html). You're welcome to use more creative module, function and variable names than I did :)

Once you complete it, type this command to write your terminal history to a text file:

`history > my_history.txt`

Upload the file `my_history.txt` to Slack and @mention me for credit.
