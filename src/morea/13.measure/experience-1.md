### Take a quiz

One of our students is working with a software company that is trying to improve on Laulima. To do our part in furthering this noble cause, I'll use their app to make a quiz that covers the first 6 weeks' material, plus the first two chapters of the free [Python for Informatics](http://www.pythonlearn.com/html-270/) textbook.

For one point:

- Sign up for the quiz by @mentioning me on Slack. (This is not a required assignment!)
- Download the software [here](https://www.digiexam.se/en/get-started) under "Students, download DigiExam"
- Take the quiz (available online from 12 Oct to 16 Oct), and tell me about your results in Slack

For a second point:

- Complete a brief interview on your experience in order to help the devs improve their product. (Details TBD.)
