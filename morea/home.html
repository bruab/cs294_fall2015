<h4 id="command-line-vine-contest">Command Line Vine Contest</h4>

<p>Someone mentioned animated gifs and vines in class. I’ll offer 1 point to anyone who submits one which demonstrates something you can do at the command line. It doesn’t have to be Python, but it can be. Inspired by <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cloud-to-butt-plus/apmlngnhgbnjpajelfkmabhkfapgnoai">this chrome plugin</a>, here is <a href="http://imgur.com/Dgk4Le9">mine</a>. Best submission (to be decided by popular vote) gets three points. Deadline: Tuesday, September 15.</p>

<h4 id="blog-post-grades">Blog Post Grades</h4>

<p>Your first three blog posts aren’t due until Friday, 9/4, but I’ve graded most of what’s been submitted. Some of you have really pushed the boundaries of slackery; some of you got bonus points. To see examples of posts worth 1.5-2 points, take a look at <a href="http://gigaelectronvolts.tumblr.com/post/127461192421/data-sharing">this one</a> or <a href="https://johfa.wordpress.com/2015/08/25/the-development-environment/">this one</a> or maybe <a href="https://mkb0517.wordpress.com/2015/08/26/describing-my-dev-environment-because-apparently-thats-a-thing/">this one</a>. Notice the presence of links, images, good organization, thoroughness, introspection and snark.</p>
